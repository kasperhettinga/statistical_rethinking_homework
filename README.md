# statistical_rethinking_homework
Book code, practices and homework from github for the statistical rethinking book and 2022 course

I am nowhere near an expert on Bayesian statisticst, but wanted to practice and decided to get my code on github
Not all solutions may be best, and also in the book code I made adaptations (simplifications) when I thought it could be done easier
Feel free to comment, use, improve!

The basis of my learning has been the statistical rethinking book:
https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/

The packages used and how to install them was using this as a basis:
https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking

The homework for the course was here:
